**Problem Statement:**
The project aims to scrape inclusive and up-to-date data on property listings, including pricing details, to gain insights into the current state of the housing market in Northern California by Essex. This helps us to assess the current market situation of housing prices in Northern California.

**Data:**
The data is collected through web scraping techniques, targeting Essex website. This involves extracting detailed information from the houses listed in Essex such as community title, property price, floor details, geographic details, accessibility score etc. The scraping scripts were written using selenium.
Key Attributes: Property Price, City name, No of rooms, No of baths, Square ft details, Accessibility score.

**Tools & Libraries:** Python (Scripting), Selenium (Web scraping), CSV File (Data storage), Pandas (Data exploration and
analysis), Seaborn, Matplot lib (Data Visualizations), Scikit learn (ML Models) & Jupyter Notebook (IDE).

**Methods:**
1. Scarped the data using selenium and imported to a CSV file.
2. Read the CSV file and cleaned the data in pandas like removing null values, duplicates, outliers, handling
categorical Variables etc.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Implemented Machine Learning models

**Expected Outcome:**
Through this project, we are predicting the key attributes that are affecting the housing prices in Northern California. This pricing analysis provides information on the economic factors which effects the property values, current market patterns and community development.
